It's already been 10,000 blocks on our new network. Let's take a look at some of the work that has been going on in that time:

## New GUI Wallet version v0.3.8 out
This fixes a bug that was causing it to not fetch the public node list properly, please update as soon as you can if you are using this.

## WebWallet release
We've ported Shellnet, which is a fantastic webwallet coded by DSAnon, over so that anyone can send and receive Aeon Classic regardless of what kind of hardware they are on. IN addition, we've released an android app companion for it so you can log in on your phone. Please make sure you export your keys if you are using this; if you forget your password we will not be able to reset it. Export your keys and keep them somewhere safe.

## Website Rewriting
We've updated the releases portion of the website to point to the GUI wallet primarily instead of the command line. We think this well benefit our users by simplifing access to the network, and us nerds can still find the cli client if they so choose.
We've also updated the message on our website in order to be a little more clear about our goals for this coin and why we started this project, it would mean alot if you'd check it out.

## New Slogan Contest
We want to replace the slogan on the website. Currently it reads "Aeon Classic isn't just a currency. It's a lifestyle." We don't think this meshes well with our project's main goals (lightweight private blockchain that works on your phone). So we're running a contest to pick a new name. Here are the steps to enter:

1.  Follow us on twitter at https://twitter.com/AeonClassic
2.  @ us with your idea for the slogan

We'll pick 3 that we like the best and then put it up to a final community for a vote. The top 3 slogans will split a pot of 1200 XMLC as follows: 
1st place 800 XMLC and use of your slogan on the official website
2nd place 300 XMLC
3rd place 100 XMLC

Thanks everyone and good luck
